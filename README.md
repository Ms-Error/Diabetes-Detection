# Diabetes-Detection

## Objective
To build a predictive model which classifies whether a person is diabetic or not based on the parameters
  1. Pregnancies
  2. Glucose
  3. Blood Pressure
  4. Skin Thickness
  5. Insulin
  6. BMI
  7. Diabetes pedigree function
  8. Age
 
## Libraries Used:
  1. Numpy *(for linear-algebra)*
  2. Pandas *(for data manipulation)*
  3. Scikit-learn *(for data modeling)*
  
## Steps Involve:
  - Importing Dataset
  - Analyse the Dataset
  - Splitting up of data
  - Applying ML algorithm
  - Evalutation of model
  
## Applying ML Algorithm
Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (x) to discrete output variables (y).

### Linear Classifiers: 

 - logistic regression
 - Nearest neighbor
 - Random forest
